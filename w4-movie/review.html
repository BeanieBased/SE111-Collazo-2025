                    <p><i>Coraline</i> is a childhood movie of mine. It's my favorite movie. It's dark, it's funny, it's scary. It's a children's film that honestly sometimes I think shouldn't be for children. I know many people who are afraid of this movie, but they also probably haven't watched it since they were little. It's a great movie, it has a perfect twist, I don't think there's any flaws in this movie, and there's so many positives. Every time I rewatch, I find a new detail that I've always missed, or a new foreshadow that I've missed. The side cast of the movie is fun and interesting, Wybie being my favorite.</p>
