  <p>My name is Justyn Collazo. I am 19 years old, and I live in Cumberland Rhode Island with my sister, my parents, and my dog. I have 3 sisters total, 2 of them are older than me and are moved out, and I have one younger sister who also attends NEIT. I work as an assistant manager at FYE, in North Attleboro.</p>
